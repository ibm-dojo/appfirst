# Migrating from a [dojox/app](https://github.com/dmachi/dojox_application) project to dapp

## Notes for applications

1. Update the config to replace any use of "dojox/app" with "dapp".
2. Currently dapp includes controllers which support delite and deliteful, so view templates and controllers will have
to be migrated to use delite/deliteful.
